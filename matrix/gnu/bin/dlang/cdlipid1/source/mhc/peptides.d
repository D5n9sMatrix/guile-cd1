 * The microse quencing29 of MHC bound peptides revealed length and sequence-based capture motifs,30 including nonamer peptides *
 * matching the length of the MHC class I groove,31,32 whereas open-ended MHC class II grooves capture longer peptides28        * 
 * with ragged ends.33 These capture motifs later emerged as essential for translational research in autoimmunity, infection,   *
 * and vaccines because they represent the key tools needed for epitope mapping and otherwise predict which particular mole-    *
 * cules will be recognized by T cells.3                                                                                        *

// The enclosed nature of CD1 clefts predicts that size motifs for lipid anchors might exist, and if so, the nearly 
// non-polymorphic nature of CD1 proteins means that any solved motifs would apply to all humans.
